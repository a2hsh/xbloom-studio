"""xBloom Studio integration for Home Assistant — BLE-only.

Architecture:

  * Recipe data comes from the public xBloom share endpoint
    (`RecipeDetail.html`) — no authentication.
  * Recipes the user wants in HA are stored in HA's local storage and added
    via the integration's options flow.
  * Brewing is BLE-only: connect-on-demand via HA's bluetooth integration.
    The recipe blob is built locally by `vendor.xbloom.ble.encode_recipe_blob`
    and the 5-frame brew sequence is written to the machine. Live status
    (scale weight, brew state, brew events) streams from FFE2 notifications
    during the brew, then HA disconnects so the iOS app can take BLE.

Earlier phases shipped a Pi MQTT bridge + cloud auth + always-on listener;
all gone. See `git log` for the full evolution.
